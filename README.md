# Learn C# in 7 days
This is the code repository for [Learn C# in 7 days](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-c-7-days?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787287044), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The book begins by teaching you the basic fundamentals using real-world practical examples and gets you acquainted with C# programming. We cover features such as variables, syntax, control flows, and then move on to concepts such as statements, arrays, string processing, method, inheritance, and I/O handling.

Later, you’ll explore the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through a real-world example. Then we dive into advanced-level concepts such as generics and collections, and you’ll get acquainted with objects and LINQ. Towards the end, you’ll build an application that covers all the concepts explained in the book.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Code bundle does not contain code files for chapter 1 and 8.

The code will look like the following:
```
var class1 = newClassExample(); 
var class2 = new Day02New.ClassExample(); 
    class1.Display(); 
    class2.Display(); 
```

All supporting code samples in this book have been tested on .NET Core 2.0 using Visual Studio 2017 update 3, database using SQL Server 2008R2 or later on the Windows platform.
